This is a road:

As you can see, cars drive on the right side of the road. Unless you live in some sort of mirror dimension a.k.a. britain.

Now, imagine a city street with a sidewalk next to it:

I'm amazing at drawing I know.

Please, my fellow pedestrians; imagine a dividing line down the middle of the sidewalk and then walk on the right half. Just like we do it on roads.

Poor lad up there has to dodge the trees but nevertheless he's conforming to this unwritten rule.

And I feel like 95% of people are, probably without even realizing it. Still, every day on my way to work, the other 5% of people will happily run into me head-on like a deer mesmerized by the lights, and then you have to do this silly game of slightly stepping left or right until you've come to an agreement as to who goes where.

To all these people, please read my blog post and please just start walking on the right half of the sidewalk. And if you don't, may lightning strike you while you're on the toilet.
