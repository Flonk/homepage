This is part 4 of a series on Free objects.
[You can find part 3 here](/blog/2025-07-04-free-objects-3).

We've seen three types of mathematical structures: Commutative monoids, monoids, and magmas. They each spawn three types of data structures,
their so-called _Free objects_: Multisets, lists, and binary finger trees.

Now, if we recall the definition of monoid or magma, we will know that
it's trivially true that any commutative monoid is also a monoid, and any monoid is also a magma; since a monoid for example is any binary operation on a set that is associative and has a unit; and a commutative monoid is just
that plus extra stuff.

I've been keeping the maths fairly light but we could formalize this
by defining what's called a _forgetful functor_ that takes any
commutative monoid and forgets about the commutativity; what's left
over is just a regular monoid. But let's not get into the details
of that.

Anyway we can define a sort of hierarchy between these three
structures that looks like so:

$$
\begin{CD}
\text{Magma} @<<< \text{Monoid} @<<< \text{C.\ Monoid}
\end{CD}
$$

Obviously the _forgetting_ won't work so easily in the other direction, like
no matter how hard you try you won't be able to make subtraction
on numbers a monoid by making it associative.

What's perhaps even more interesting though is that the emergent
data structures also form a hierarchy, but in the other direction!

That is, we can take any binary finger tree and turn it into
a list, in a canonical way. If you've worked with trees before, you might
be familiar with the term \*in-order tree traversal\*\* -- it's where
you take a tree, and you visit the left child, then the parent, and then the right child, recursively. In code:

```ts
type BFT<T> =
  | { type: "leaf"; value: T }
  | { type: "node"; left: BFT<T>; right: BFT<T> };

const forgetBft = <T>(tree: BFT<T>): T[] => {
  if (tree.type === "leaf") return [tree.value];
  return [...forget(tree.left), ...forget(tree.right)];
};
```

This would turn both of the trees from our previous post:

```ts
"A tree for (1 - 2) - 3:"

      -
     / \
    -   3
   / \
  1   2

"And a tree for 1 - (2 - 3):"

      -
     / \
    1   -
       / \
      2   3
```

into the same list `[1, 2, 3]`.

And we can also turn lists into multisets, by counting how often
any value appears in the list. I will leave that as an exercise for you.

This yields a very interesting looking diagram:

$$
\begin{CD}
\text{Magma} @<<< \text{Monoid} @<<< \text{C.\ Monoid} \\
@V{\mathrm{Free}}VV @V{\mathrm{Free}}VV @V{\mathrm{Free}}VV \\
\text{BFT} @>>> \text{List} @>>> \text{Multiset}
\end{CD}
$$

What I think is interesting about this is how when the binary
operation gets more restrictive, the data structure gets
more general.

Like, a commutative monoid is a very specific kind of algebraic structure, and the free object for it is a multiset, which is a very "loose"
collection of values. Magmas on the other hand are very general --
pretty much every binary operation forms a magma. But, the resulting
free object, the binary finger tree, is much more structured than
the multiset.

How will that help you in your day-to-day programming?

Probably not at all. Perhaps we could make a deep point about how
data and evaluation are two sides of the same coin, and perhaps I
could invite you to look into your own codebases and spot all the magmas
and monoids you spawn ad-hoc everyday when you call `.reduce` on
your lists.

But I'm a bit peckish and I haven't showered yet so I'ma do that
instead.

Though, it can be fun to think about what kinds of algebraic
structures give rise to which data structures. Take magmas that
are commutative but not associative for example! Rock-paper-scissors
is one:

```
🪨 <> 📄 = 🪨
📄 <> ✂️ = 📄
✂️ <> 🪨 = ✂️

commutativity: yes! 🪨 <> 📄 = 📄 <> 🪨 = 🪨
associativity: no! (🪨 <> 📄) <> ✂️ = 🪨 <> ✂️, but 📄 <> (✂️ <> 🪨) = 📄
```

What free object would rock-paper-scissors give rise to?

Take a datastructure that is even less structured than a multiset,
like sets! What algebraic structure would you need such that it's
free object is a set?
