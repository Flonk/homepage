On the thirteenth day of christmas, my true love gave to me... a typescript type diagram, tee hee!

Teal squares represent literal types -- as many of you will know, `0` is not only a valule,
but also a type in typescript, which is one of typescript's cooler features. Arrows represent
a subtype relationship -- so for example, `1` is a subtype of `number`, and `number` is a subtype of `unknown`.

Roughly we can categorize types in typescript into the "primitives", like `string`, `number`,
and "reference types", like objects and arrays and functions.

Especially notable are `unknown`, which is the supertype of all types, and `never`, which is
the subtype of all types. This is not something that we think about in day-to-day programming,
but it's true: the function `const foo = <T extends unknown>(x: T) => {}` and `const foo = <T>(x: T) => {}`
are the same -- since everything inherits from `unknown` anyway, it's redundant to specify it.

`never` is typically used to denote dead code paths, or impossible types, so it maybe seems odd to 
call it a subtype of all types. For now the only justification I will give is "in typescript it's true",
meanining if you have `const foo = <T extends number>(x: T) => {}`, you can indeed call `foo` with a value of type `never`.
You'll have a hard type finding a value of type `never`, but your code will typecheck just fine.


Oh yeah. And then there's `any`.

It's *simultaneously* the subtype and supertype of all types, breaking the nice property of mathematical
structures called "lattices", that every two types should have a unique supertype and subtype. `any` is more
like an escape hatch that disables type checking though, so it's not really meant to be used in the same way as other types.
