We've seen the "for all" quantifier `∀` in System F now, which allows
us to define generic functions that must work for any type. We've also
seen that such functions are very limited in what they can do with their
arguments, since the only things you can do with a value of a generic type
`A` are things that you can do to any type, whether it's `Int`, `String`, or
`Horse`.

There is also a related but dual concept called **existential quantification**,
which is written with the symbol `∃`, meaning "there exists". This will allow 
us to express things like "I need a value of some type, but I don't care what type it is,
as long as it satisfies certain properties".

An example will be better than words here. Let's assume a mishmash of System F and
typescript:

```typescript
type Showable = ∃A. { value: A, toString: (A -> String) };

function show(s: Showable): String {
  return s.toString(s.value);
}
```
