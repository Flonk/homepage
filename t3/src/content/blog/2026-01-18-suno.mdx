Sometimes I wake up and I have a random melody in my head, or maybe
5 seconds of an orchestral arrangement. I whistle it to myself under
the shower, and as I continue my day it fleets away just like it came.

I've often considered writing these snippets down, but even if I 
did, it probably wouldn't suddenly make me create an album because I
don't have the skillset to produce good-sounding music in a DAW, and learning
it takes literal years. My piano playing isn't good enough either to where
I can express *ideas* on the keyboard, the hands are simply too
caught up in the mechanics of it.

Music man. It's something I really wish I were better at but I don't
have the grit to see it through.

Well just the other day a cowoker did a brownbag presentation
about [Suno AI](https://suno.ai/) (shoutout to Nuris \<3), and I mean I had
seen it before -- there was a phase where everyone and their mothers
sent meme songs to each other -- but I was triggered to revisit
it this week, and wow their v5 model has gotten REALLY good.

Come on? If this was released in '97 people would lose their minds.

I mean it's not like I'm talking any credit for it, all I did was write a prompt
and listened through 20 variations until I found one I liked.

But. You know how like some producers were really well known for their
meticulous drum programming -- Photek for example. Ni Ten Ichi Ryu
is still one of my favourite tunes, even though I was 4 years old when
it came out... but good music is timeless man. Listen to the drum variety!

It must have been hours and hours of painstaking work to get those drum
patterns right in those early versions of Cubase.

And with Suno, you can do it in seconds. Seconds! It's not like AI 
needs to copy paste 8 bars of a drum pattern over and over to save time,
it just *imagines* drums continuously so you get these natural variations
for free basically.

And like if I can lay down an IDM breakbeat in 3/4 meter while I have 
a finger up my butt and the other hand covered in cheeto dust, then
it'll be interesting to see what actually skilled musicians can do with AI.

Sure there are kinks yet to be ironed out, the lack of control you often
have over the AIs output does feel super limiting, and editing the output
doesn't work well at all yet, so you either have to take the AIs output
or leave it. But it's early days, right?

AI really is the great democratizer of art.

<sup>**Prompt used**: Short tune, 2 minutes, A jungle drum and bass waltz in 3/4 time, amen breaks, chopped up samples, In the beginning, we hear a lighter and someone hitting a joint, before we delve into break-heavy jungle sounds, with woodwind instruments emulating bird sounds, For the drop, we move underwater where everything becomes dreamy and reverby and gloomy synthesizers take over in descending voice lines, For the second drop we dip into the jungle again, with woodwinds taking us back home, and a NAAAASTY neurofunk section closing us off, Make it waltzy and waltz-danceable, but also jamaican dubby</sup>
