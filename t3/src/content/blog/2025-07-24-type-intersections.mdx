`&` in TypeScript is called the intersection operator.

Why tho? If you're familiar with set intersections it might
seem like `&` works exactly the wrong way around... like,
intersecting the sets `{1, 2, 3}` and `{2, 3, 4}` gives you
`{2, 3}` -- it's the subset of elements that exist
in both sets.

But in Typescript, `{ foo: string } & { bar: number }` gives
`{ foo: string, bar: number }` -- we get all properties of either
type. Isn't that more like a union?

## Well

No.

There's a very formal reason why the "type intersection" is called
as such, and it has to do with the Liskov Substitution Principle.

Take a look at the following function definitions:

```ts
const foo = (x: { foo: string }) => x.foo;
const bar = (x: { bar: number }) => x.bar;
```

`foo` takes `Foo`s, and `bar` takes `Bar`s, but our intersection
type `{ foo: string } & { bar: number }` can be passed to either
function.

So if you imagine `{ foo: string }` and `{ bar: number }` as circles
on a Venn Diagram, then our intersection type is like the middle part.
Our foobar can go to the foo club _and_ the bar club, so to speak, because
the foobar is a subtype of the foos and a subtype of the bars.

The Venn Diagram and it's intersection in this case doesn't show a
subset relationship, but rather a subtype relationship!

It is kind of funny tho how the type with _more_ properties
will be a subtype of the type with _fewer_ properties but that's
just what follows from the above.

And what follows from that is that the empty type `{}` isn't
actually a subtype of any other type, while the empty set `{}`
is a subset of every set. The "empty set" equivalent of types
would be the type that contains _all_ properties, and where
each property can be anything.

Turns out typescript has not one but two built-in types for that:
`unknown`, and `any`.
