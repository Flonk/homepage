Let's take a binary operation that is _associative_ and _commutative_, like addition on numbers.

In case you forgot, addition is associative because you can swap brackets around or leave them out altoghether without changing the result, like $ (2 + 4) + 3 = 2 + (4 + 3) = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 $. And it is commutative because you can swap the order of the numbers too, like $ 2 + 4 = 4 + 2 $.

We call this -- a binary operation like addition, and some set, like numbes -- a **group** by the way. Or more appropriately an commutative semigroup but let's not complicate things. Addition on numbers $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ is a group for example, multiplication on numbers $(\mathbb{R}, \cdot)$ is another example.

And say that instead of just calculating the result, we would like to keep tack of what numbers
were added together, so that we can reconstruct the result later.

For associative and commutative operations, the "smallest" possible datatype that can store that information is a **multiset**.

For example, the addition expression $ 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 $ could be represented, in
(almost) typescript, like so:

```ts
type Multiset<T> = Map<T, number>;

const multiset: Multiset<number> = new Map([
  [1, 3],
  [2, 1],
  [3, 1],
  [4, 2],
]);
```

That is, three ones, one two, one three, and two fours.

And we can then reconstruct the addition expression by iterating over the multiset and adding the numbers together, like so:

```ts
type BinaryOperation<T> = (a: T, b: T) => T;
const add: BinaryOperation<number> = (a, b) => a + b;

const evaluate = <T>(
  multiset: Multiset<T>,
  operation: BinaryOperation<T>
): T => {
  let result: T;

  for (const [value, count] of multiset.entries()) {
    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      result = result === undefined ? value : operation(result, value);
    }
  }

  return result;
};

const result = evaluate(multiset, add); // 16
```

I've also introduced a type `BinaryOperation<T>` and
abstracted the addition away, since technically the multiset
doesn't store any information about the operation we use to
evaluate it. The multiset for the expression
$ 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 $ would
look exactly the same, and we could use the same `evaluate`
function and pass `(a, b) => a * b` as the operation to get the
result (96).

That makes the multiset rather special! Like, given just the result
of the addition (16), there would be no way to reconstruct the
result of the multiplication (96) from it, because solving
the addition problem destroyed information about the numbers
that went in, in a way that the multiset does not.

And in a way the multiset doesn't evaluate anything, it just keeps
track of what is supposed to happen.

Not only that, we can also _define a binary operation on multisets
themselves_ that is both associative and commutative. Look at this:

```ts
const merge = <T>(a: Multiset<T>, b: Multiset<T>): Multiset<T> => {
  const result = new Map<T, number>(a);

  for (const [value, count] of b.entries()) {
    result.set(value, (result.get(value) ?? 0) + count);
  }

  return result;
};
```

And ok, I will only do this once, but lets take our original
addition problem $ 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 $ again and move it
into the realm of multisets:

```ts
// helper function to not go insane
const lift = <T>(value: T): Multiset<T> => new Map([[value, 1]]);

const expression = merge(
  merge(
    merge(merge(lift(1), lift(1)), merge(lift(1), lift(2))),
    merge(lift(3), merge(lift(4), lift(4)))
  )
);

const result = evaluate(expression, add); // 16
```

I've nested the merge calls rather arbitrarily, but that's okay
since our operation is associative, meaning bracketing doesn't
matter!

## Exercises

1. Go ahead an convince yourself that `expression` and our
   original addition problem are equivalent. To do that, just replace
   each call to `merge` with `+`, and `lift` with nothing I guess.

2. Convince yourself that the `merge` operation is associative.
   Do that by taking some multisets `a`, `b`, and `c`, and
   showing that `merge(merge(a, b), c)` is the same as
   `merge(a, merge(b, c))`.

3. Convince yourself that the `merge` operation is commutative.
   Do that by taking some multisets `a` and `b`, and
   showing that `merge(a, b)` is the same as `merge(b, a)`.

## Final thoughts

There's three things I'd like you to take away from this:

- We have found a way to decouple data from evaluation. We've stated
  the addition problem in a way that just stores all the data,
  but does not compute anything until we call `evaluate`.
- The multiset is like the mother-of-all-groups. Given a
  multiset, we can "move" into the addition group just by
  calling `evaluate` with the addition operation. And we can
  move into the multiplication group by calling `evaluate`
  with the multiplication operation. We can't move from the addition
  group to the multiplication group this way, i.e. we
  can't reconstruct 96 from 16.

And most importantly.

Not all types have well-known groups, like numbers have addition
or multiplication. You can't add two objects of type
`DatabaseRepository` or `DogApple`, generally speaking. **But,
given any type `T`, we always know there is at least one group:
`Multiset<T>`**.

This is why we call `Multiset<T>` the **free group** on type `T`.

We get it for free so to speak, it just always exists.
