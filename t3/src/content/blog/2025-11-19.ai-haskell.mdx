Probably not.

But, AI has made me rather lazy to say the least. I just let the AI generate AI slop and as long as it conforms to the types and validation rules I set out, I'm happy. And I don't really care about code style anymore -- I might suggest refactorings to DRY up the AI slop a bit but for the most part I don't even read code anymore, just the AI summary.

In Haskell, there is that old saying that if your code compiles, it's probably correct. That's because the type system is super expressive and strong, and you'll have to model all your side effects in the type system as well. That leads to an interesting way of writing code aswell, where most of what you do is to just get your code to typecheck.

Well -- if all I do in my day-to-day work is writing down types and having the AI generate all the stuff in between, then isn't Haskell a better fit over say, typescript? I can write down very precise types, and then I have the AI generate AI slop, but it'll be very restricted AI slop, and by restricting the AI we are setting it up to stumble into correcter solutions.

I'm not sure what the future of coding will look like, but to me it seems very certain that we, developers, will be moving higher up in the lambada calculus chain -- meaning more types, less code.

And Haskell may not be the language to take over, but I do think that the future will be functional.
