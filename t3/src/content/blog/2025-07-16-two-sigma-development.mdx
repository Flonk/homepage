No I'm not lowballing, just realistic.

Programs exist in only two states: buggy, and formally correct.

Of course we all think we write formally correct code but then
due to `$NOT_MY_FAULT_REASON` that one function that shouldn't throw _here_,
because I know it doesn't throw _here_, actually throws.

The other extreme is formal correctness, where "formal" in the
everyday sense means "operating correctly" under a predefined set
of business rules and assumptions over the entire problem domain.

Not only can we never get there because formal verification is hard
and expensive, but also because our business rules are usually not well-defined,
and assumptions are false.

And even if we had a way to know formally correct behaviour,
we usually don't have the time and money to implement it.

So my new way of developing software is pretending to know formally
correct behaviour and to _consider_ all the edge cases, but opt-out
when I don't think that edge case has a high enough probability
of happening.

Which is a fancy way of saying I did a try-catch today and I'm
patting myself on the back for it.

```typescript
function main() {
  const result = thisDoesntThrowHerePinkyPromise();
}
```

This is a bug waiting to happen, whereas this is two-sigma development:

```typescript
function main() {
  try {
    const result = thisDoesntThrowHerePinkyPromise();
  } catch (e) {
    throw new UnreachableError(
      "I have no fucking clue what to do in this case",
      e
    );
  }
}
```

The latter snippet communicates to other developers that I considered
the possibility of an error, but that I didn't consider it worth
handling. But, if the three-sigma event happens, we know where to look,
and where to implement a fix.

This doesn't influence the time it takes to implement my feature,
but everyone benefits. It's an easy win. (Though obviously this will
never fly at code review so you have to be a bit more subtle about it.)
