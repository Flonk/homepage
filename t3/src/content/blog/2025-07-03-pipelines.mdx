title: "Pipeline runs grow nÂ² with the number of open PRs"

There are $ n $ open pull requests. One pull requests is merged;
now $ n - 1 $ developers will press the "sync" button on their
PR, resulting in $ n - 1 $ pipeline runs.

Continue until all PRs are merged, and you end up with
$ \mathcal{O}(n^2) $ pipeline runs in total.

I guess what I'm saying is that if you're in one of those well-
managed teams where nobody merges anything until the end of the
sprint where suddenly everyone gets stressed out, that hurts
your bottom line in more ways than one.
