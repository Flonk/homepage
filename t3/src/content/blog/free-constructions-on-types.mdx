**DRAFT -- this is very much work in progress.**

Turns out binary finger trees, lists and multisets are very closely related, and I'd like to tell you about it.

Remember first semester maths? Yeah? No? Maybe?

If no, here's a refresher.

Know we can swap numbers around when adding, like $ 2 + 4 = 4 + 2 $? That's what we call **commutativity**.

And then there's the bracketing thing, called **associativity**. It means that order of operations doesn't matter when adding many numbers, because in whichever order we sum the numbers, the result is the same: $ (2 + 4) + 3 = 2 + (4 + 3) = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 $.

Usually we also try to isolate a special **identity element** that does _nothing_ in a sense, that would be $ 0 $ for addition. We'll gloss over that today though.

Let's try to find some examples of operations that do and do not have these properties.

## Examples

Obviously we found **addition** on numbers $(\mathbb{R}, +)$. It's both commutative and associative:

- **<Green>Commutativity</Green>**: $ 2 + 4 = 4 + 2 $
- **<Green>Associativity</Green>**: $ (2 + 4) + 3 = 2 + (4 + 3) = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 $

**Multiplication** $(\mathbb{R}, \cdot)$ satisfies these properties aswell:

- **<Green>Commutativity</Green>**: $ 2 \cdot 4 = 4 \cdot 2 $
- **<Green>Associativity</Green>**: $ (2 \cdot 4) \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot (4 \cdot 3) = 2
  \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 24 $

<p></p>

**Subtraction** $(\mathbb{R}, -)$ does not have these properties:

- **<Red>Commutativity</Red>**: $ 2 - 4 = -2$, but $ 4 - 2 = 2 $
- **<Red>Associativity</Red>**: $ (2 - 4) - 3 = -5$, but $ 2 - (4 - 3) = 1 $

<p></p>

**Division** $(\mathbb{R}, /)$ does not have these properties either:

- **<Red>Commutativity</Red>**: $ 2 / 4 = 0.5$, but $ 4 / 2 = 2 $
- **<Red>Associativity</Red>**: $ (2 / 4) / 3 = 0.041\overline{6}$, but $ 2 / (4 / 3) = 1.5 $

<p></p>

It's kinda interesting how addition and multiplication have these properties, but their inverse operations subtraction and division do not.

Anyway, how about an operation that is associative but not commutative? Check out **concatenation of strings** $(string, +)$:

- **<Red>Commutativity</Red>**: `"foo" + "bar" ===  "foobar"`, but `"bar" + "foo" === "barfoo"`
- **<Green>Associativity</Green>**: `("foo" + "bar") + "baz" === "foo" + ("bar" + "baz") === "foobarbaz"`

Okay.. and here's a fun operation that is commutative but not associative: **Rock Paper Scissors**, $(\{Rock, Paper, Scissors\}, ✊)$:

- **<Green>Commutativity</Green>**: `Rock ✊ Paper === Paper ✊ Rock === Paper`
- **<Red>Associativity</Red>**: `(Rock ✊ Paper) ✊ Scissors === Scissors`, but `Rock ✊ (Paper ✊ Scissors) === Rock`

<p></p>

### A couple more maths words

Usually we organize these operations into a hierarchy, based on the properties they have.

- **Magma**: Anything. Just any set or type, and any binary operation on it. Like subtraction on numbers.
- **Semigroup**: A magma that is associative.
- **Commutative Semigroup**: A semigroup that is commutative.

Any commutative semigroup is also a semigroup, and any semigroup is also a magma. Keep that in mind.

## Magmas make trees?

Let's take our old friend subtraction on numbers, and a fairly complicated expression like

$$
(1 - 2) - (3 - ((4 - 5) - 6))
$$

If you take the outermost "-" and pinch it with your fingers, letting the rest of the expression dangle, you will see a tree structure emerge:

```haskell
     ( )
    /   \
  ( )    \
 /   \    \
1     2    \
           ( )
          /   \
         3    ( )
             /   \
           ( )    6
          /   \
         4     5
```

If you were to evaluate this expression, you'd start from the bottom -- corresponding to the innermost bracket -- and work your way up.

```haskell
     ( )                     ( )                     ( )
    /   \                   /   \                   /   \
  ( )    \                ( )    \                ( )    \
 /   \    \              /   \    \              /   \    \
1     2    \     -->    1     2    \     -->    1     2    \     -->
           ( )                     ( )                     ( )
          /   \                   /   \                   /   \
         3    ( )                3    ( )                3    -7
             /   \                   /   \
           ( )    6                 -1    6
          /   \
         4     5


      ( )
     /   \
   ( )    \   -->    ( )    -->   -11
  /   \    \        /   \
 1     2    10    -1    10

```

What's interesting about this tree right here is that only the leaf nodes contain actual values, and all the other nodes contain no useful information. This is a special type of tree, called a **(binary) finger tree**.

What's also interesting is that this tree representation doesn't contain any information about the operation we used. If we instead tried to make a tree for $ (1 \cdot 2) \cdot (3 \cdot ((4 \cdot 5) \cdot 6)) $ it would look exactly the same.

Let's try to put this into typescript. Here you see a binary finger tree type, aswell as an evaluate function that does what we just did above.

```typescript
type BFT<T> =
  | { type: "leaf"; value: T }
  | {
      type: "node";
      left: BFT<T>;
      right: BFT<T>;
    };

type BinaryOperation<T> = (a: T, b: T) => T;

const evaluate = <T>(tree: BFT<T>, operation: BinaryOperation<T>): T => {
  if (tree.type === "leaf") return tree.value;

  return operation(
    evaluate(tree.left, operation),
    evaluate(tree.right, operation)
  );
};

const subtract: BinaryOperation<number> = (a, b) => a - b;
evaluate(exampleTree, subtract); // -11
```

## The free magma

It turns out that `BFT<T>` forms a **magma** by itself. Remember that a magma is just any set and a binary operation; the set here is all `BFT<T>` for a fixed `T`, and we can find a binary operation that takes two trees and merges them.

```typescript
const merge = <T>(a: BFT<T>, b: BFT<T>): BFT<T> => ({
  type: "node",
  left: a,
  right: b,
});
```

And this magma right here `(BFT<T>, merge)`, is a special one! It's what we call the **free magma** on type `T`.

As we've shown, you can translate any subtraction expression into an equivalent expression in our binary finger tree magma. And if we want to get back into the realm of subtraction and recover the result we would have gotten by subtracting instead of merging trees, we can do that by running our `evaluate` function with the `subtract` operation.

In other words, these two snippets do the same:

```typescript
const subtraction = 1 - (2 - 3);

//////////////////////////////////////

const leaf = (value: number) => ({ type: "leaf", value }); // helper function

const tree = merge(leaf(1), merge(leaf(2), leaf(3)));
const result = evaluate(tree, subtract);
```

<p></p>

How cool is that.

There's a few points to make here:

- We've successfully seperated data from evaluation. `merge` is like a binary operation that doesn't actually calculate anything, it just records all the values that went into the expression.
- Evaluation in the magma of subtraction destroys information, in a way that BFTs do not. Give any BFT we can recover the result of the subtraction, but given the result of a subtraction, we can't reconstruct the BFT that caused the result. _This makes the free magma special, and unique among all the magmas_.
- The free magma, BFTs, exist for _any_ type. Like, addition is well-defined on numbers, but not on `DatabaseRepository` or `DogApple`. A BFT does not care about what type it contains.

## Free Semigroups

So that's neat. We can find a similar construction for semigroups; let's take our string concatenation semigroup we defined in the beginning. Given

$$
("1" + "2") + ("3" + (("4" + "5") + "6"))
$$

we could obviously construct a BFT from it also. After all, all semigroups are magmas so everything we said before holds for semigroups aswell.

But remember that associativity means that we can swap brackets around whichever way we want, so all these expressions are the same:

$$
("1" + "2") + ("3" + (("4" + "5") + "6")) \\
("1" + "2") + ("3" + ("4" + ("5" + "6"))) \\
("1" + ("2" + ("3" + ("4" + ("5" + "6")))))
$$

And therefor, all the BFTs we could generate from these expressions evaluate to the same result aswell:

```haskell
     ( )                   ( )                       ( )
    /   \                 /   \                     /   \
  ( )    \              ( )    \                   1    ( )
 /   \    \            /   \    \                      /   \
1     2    \          1     2    \                    2    ( )
           ( )                   ( )                      /   \
          /   \                 /   \                    3    ( )
         3    ( )              3    ( )                      /   \
             /   \                 /   \                    4    ( )
           ( )    6               4    ( )                      /   \
          /   \                       /   \                    5     6
         4     5                     5     6
```

So our BFT type is perhaps not the most tightly fitting type for semigroups.

At the end of the day I'm saying in a very roundabout way we established at the very beginning: that we can drop all brackets for associative operations:

$$
"1" + "2" + "3" + "4" + "5" + "6"
$$

This more closely resembles a list of strings that are being added together in sequence.

This gives rise to our next free construction, the **free semigroup** on type `T`, which is just a (nonempty) list of `T`, together with the binary operation of list concatenation.

Typescript already has all of this built in so we're just giving fancy names to existing things.

```typescript
type FreeSemigroup<T> = [T, ...T[]];

const concat = <T>(
  a: FreeSemigroup<T>,
  b: FreeSemigroup<T>
): FreeSemigroup<T> => a.concat(b);

const evaluate = <T>(
  list: FreeSemigroup<T>,
  operation: BinaryOperation<T>
): T => list.reduce((acc, curr) => operation(acc, curr));
```

And just like before, we have found a way to seperate data from evaluation.

```typescript
const concatenation = "1" + "2" + "3" + "4" + "5" + "6";

//////////////////////////////////////

const list: FreeSemigroup<string> = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"];
const result = evaluate(list, (a, b) => a + b);
```
