I'm not really sure why, but that one puzzle from Brooklyn 99
popped back into my head today.

That show was hilarious in general, and that particular scene
really caught me off guard and had me puzzling through the rest of
the episode, and beyond that. I ended up busting out coins
and spread them out on the kitchen table, and only after a good
night's sleep did I find the solution!

Here it is, from S02E18:

> There are 12 men on an island. 11 weigh exactly the same amount,
> but one of them is slightly lighter or heavier.
> You must figure out which.
>
> The island has no scales, but there is a seesaw. You can only
> use it three times.

And also, you must determine whether the odd man is lighter or heavier.

Go ahead, try to figure it out yourself before reading on!

It always seemed to me like you need three-and-a-quarter weighings
to solve this problem, like after three weighings you're always
lacking just the tiniest smidge of information. For example:

- Split the men into groups of four. Weigh two groups.
- If they balance, figure out which of the remaining four is
  the odd one out, which is doable.
- If they don't balance, you're left with 8 men which is just
  so many. If you weigh 2 and 2, you then end up in situations
  involving finding the odd one out of 4 men which is simply
  impossible in a single weighing.

And nothing I tried seemed to work!

## The Solution

Well instead of telling you the solution, let me share my approach,
which was reducing the problem to simpler subproblems.

A key insight for me was that you have known neutral men at your
disposal and they turn out to be really useful for weighing against
unknown men.

We use the following labels for men:

- "h" = heavy or neutral
- "l" = light or neutral
- "?" = unknown (could be heavy, light or neutral)
- "n" = known neutral

### Three Men, one is heavier - 1 weighing

Let's call this case "hhh" meaning we have three men that are
potentially heavy. You can do it in **1** weighing:

- Weigh h against h.
- If they balance, the third h is the heavy one.
- Else, wherever the seesaw tips down, that man is the heavy one.

The "hhl" case turns out to be the same as the "hhh" case by the way,
meaning if two men are potentially heavy and one is potentially light, you can
still find the odd one out in a single weighing:

- Weigh h against h.
- If they balance, l is the light one.
- Else, wherever the seesaw tips down, that man is the heavy one.

And naturally "llh" is the same aswell.

### Three Men, one is odd - 2 weighings

Let's call this case "???" meaning we have three men of unknown
weight but one of them is lighter or heaviier. For this case we now
need a second weighing:

- Weigh ? against ?
- If they balance, the third ? is the odd one out.
  - Weigh it against n to see if it's heavy or light.
- If the seesaw tips left, either the left ? is heavy or the right ? is light;
  we have specified our men to be "hln". Weigh h against n.
  - If the seesaw tips left, h is heavy.
  - If they balance, l is light.
  - If the seesaw tips right, the universe explodes.
- If the seesaw tips right, it's the same procedure but reversed.

### Four men, ???? - 2 weighings

The four man case stumped me for quite a while, until I realized
that grabbing _more_ men that aren't part of the unknown set is
actually helpful here. The neutral men are the key to this puzzle.

Here is a solution that **does not** work.

- Weigh ? against ?
- If the seesaw tips left, either the left ? is heavy or the right ? is light, so we have specified our men to be "hlnn".
- Weigh h againt n.
  - If they balance, l is light.
  - If the seesaw tips left, h is heavy.
  - If the seesaw tips right, the universe explodes.
- If the seesaw tips right, it's symmetric.
- If they balance, we have ?? left.
  - Weigh ? against n.
  - If they balance, the fourth ? is the odd one. _[not completely specified! We don't know if it's heavy or light]_
  - If the seesaw tips left, ? is heavy.
  - If the seesaw tips right, ? is light.

It's this smidgeon of missing information I mentioned eariler,
it always seems to pop up somewhere.

That is, unless we use "external" neutrals!

- Weigh ??? against nnn.
- If they balance, the fourth ? is the odd one.
  - Weigh ? against n to see if it's heavy or light.
- If the seesaw tips left, goto "hhh".
- If the seesaw tips right, goto "lll".

### Four men, hhhh - 2 weighings

If potential weight is known, four men still requires two weighings,
unfortunately.

- Weigh hh against hh.
- If they balance, the universe explodes.
- If the seesaw tips left, goto "hh".
- If the seesaw tips right, goto "hh".

Or:

- Weigh hhh against nnn.
- If they balance, the fourth h is the odd one.
- If the seesaw tips left, goto "hhh".
- If the seesaw tips right, the universe explodes.

## The actual Solution - 3 weighings

With all the easier subproblems solved, we can now tackle the original
problem of ???? ???? ????.

- Weigh ???? against ????
- If they balance, goto "????" with the remaining four men.
- If the seesaw tips left, we are left with "hhhh llll" with
  the other four men known to be neutral, and have to solve that in
  two weighings.
- If the seesaw tips right, it's symmetric.

The "hhhh llll" case is also very tricky because it's just so many
people to weigh. But we have a good grasp on what's possible to
find out in a single weighing now: to make the third weigh work,
we need to always reduce the problem to a three-man hhh, hhl, or llh.

It's a very sneaky thing you have to figure out there, we're weighing
8 men again which seems strange and also we have both heavies and lights
on both sides of the seesaw.

- Weigh hhll against hlnn
- If they balance, there's a single h and l left that are potentially odd. hl is easily solved in the third weighing.
- If the seesaw tips left, either the left hh is heavy or the right l is light, so goto "hhl".
- If the seesaw tips right, wither the left ll is light or the right h is heavy, so goto "llh".

And that's it! Three weighings to find the odd man out of twelve.
