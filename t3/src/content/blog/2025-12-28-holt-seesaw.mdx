I'm not really sure why, but that one puzzle from Brooklyn 99
popped back into my head today.

That show was hilarious in general, and that particular scene
really caught me off guard and had me puzzling through the rest of
the episode, and beyond that. I ended up busting out coins
and spread them out on the kitchen table, and only after a good
night's sleep did I find the solution!

Here it is, from S02E18:

> There are 12 men on an island. 11 weigh exactly the same amount,
> but one of them is slightly lighter or heavier.
> You must figure out which.
>
> The island has no scales, but there is a seesaw. You can only
> use it three times.

And also, you must determine whether the odd man is lighter or heavier.

Can you figure it out?
