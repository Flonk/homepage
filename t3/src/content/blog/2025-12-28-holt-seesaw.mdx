I'm not really sure why, but that one puzzle from Brooklyn 99 S02E18
popped back into my head today.

> There are 12 men on an island. 11 weigh exactly the same amount,
> but one of them is slightly lighter or heavier.
> You must figure out which.
>
> The island has no scales, but there is a seesaw. You can only
> use it three times.

And also, you must determine whether the odd man is lighter or heavier.

Can you figure it out?
