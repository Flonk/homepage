Modulith has a very specific meaning in a Spring context but
apart from that I really don't like the word. Like. Oh, you're
splitting your monolith into meaningful parts like a good little
coder?

Like. Yeah? I mean that's just programming. I mean, what's
even the alternative?

"Yeah no at my company we don't organize code. We just have a
big file called index.ts in the repo. We call it the gigabyte
file architecture and it works better for us."

Said no one ever.

---

Anyway, let me tell you how I start my monoliths. I've at least
5 apps in production that started a bit like this; basically it's
the minimal way to get configuration from the environment and
a basic service architecture with dependency injection. Stole the
idea from the C# ASP.NET HostBuilder but it's probably a common pattern.

To parse the environment:

```typescript
// appConfiguration.ts

type AppEnvironment = Partial<{
  FOO_USER: string;
  FOO_PASSWORD: string;
  LOG_LEVEL: string;
}>;

type AppConfiguration = {
  foo: {
    user: string;
    password: string;
  };
  logLevel: LogLevel;
};

const error = (msg: string) => {
  throw new Error(msg);
};

const parseAppEnvironment = (
  env = process.env as AppEnvironment
): AppConfiguration => ({
  foo: {
    user: env.FOO_USER ?? error("FOO_USER is required"),
    password: env.FOO_PASSWORD ?? error("FOO_PASSWORD is required"),
  },
  logLevel: parseLogLevel(env.LOG_LEVEL) ?? "debug",
});
```

Note how `process.env` goes in as an argument, so you can override
it in tests.

Okay, next, the service architecture.

```typescript
// createApplication.ts
import { parseAppEnvironment } from "./appConfiguration";
import { FooService } from "../service/foo/FooService";
import { BarService } from "../service/bar/BarService";

type Service = {
  new (app: Application, config: AppConfiguration): Service;

  start?: () => void;
  stop?: () => void;
};

type Application = {
  config: AppConfiguration;
  service: {
    Foo: FooService;
    Bar: BarService;
  };
  start: () => void;
  stop: () => void;
};

const ServicesInInitializationOrder = [
  ["Foo", FooService],
  ["Bar", BarService],
];

const createApplication = (config = parseAppEnvironment()): Application => {
  const service = {} as Services;

  for (const [name, Service] of ServicesInInitializationOrder) {
    service[name] = new Service(config);
  }

  const start = () => {
    for (const service of Object.keys(ServicesInInitializationOrder)) {
      service[service].start?.();
    }
  };

  const stop = () => {
    const reverseOrder = [...ServicesInInitializationOrder].reverse();
    for (const service of Object.keys(reverseOrder)) {
      service[service].stop?.();
    }
  };

  return {
    config,
    service,
    start,
    stop,
  };
};
```

And that's it. We get dependency injection because every service
gets the `Application` object, containing all other services.

All that's left to do is to start the application:

```typescript
// index.ts
import { createApplication } from "./app/createApplication";

createApplication()
  .start()
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error("Failed to start application:", err);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Note how we have a single entrypoint into our application,
a single `createApplication` function that does everything. Which
you'd think is common practice, but many people (and frameworks!)
choose to pollute the global scope instead which I don't really
get.

Having an `Application` object and a factory for it is great for
testing too because you can create 20 apps in parallel if you
want and also the mocking becomes a lot easier.

"Yeah but spring boot does this for me if I slap 40 annotations
on an empty class, aren't you just creating your own framework?"
-- yeah, maybe. But this took me 5 minutes to set up and it works in
any stack. Note how I'm not opinionated about the logger or the
http framework or the database. All I do is start services.
You kind of need that flexibility in javascript.

Your `HttpService` can do all the controller stuff.

---

Now, the classic service architecture is one we are all very
familiar with. Which is cool, so all the devs will feel right
at home and can get cracking!

Let's say we have added a couple of features
to our monolith and the file structure looks like this:

```
src/
  ├── README.md
  ├── package.json
  ├── tsconfig.json
  ├── .env
  ├── app/
  │   ├── appConfiguration.ts
  │   └── createApplication.ts
  └── service/
      ├── foo/
      │   ├── FooService.ts
      │   └── FooController.ts
      ├── bar/
      │   ├── BarService.ts
      │   └── BarController.ts
      └── http/
          └── HttpService.ts
```

Usually I like to go deep on my APIs, meaning the services
will end up with few methods but a lot of code behind it. A
service is a module, basically.

Let's examine how one of our services, or modules, may grow
over time. The humble FooService will probably start as a single file.

```
foo/
  ├── FooService.ts
  └── FooController.ts
```

Once shoving everything into a single class becomes unmaintainable,
I'd usually have the service class just contain all the function
headers and move the implementation to a file called `utils.ts`
for lack of a better name.

```
foo/
  ├── FooService.ts
  ├── FooController.ts
  └── utils.ts
```

Eventually we split all the methods of our service into more and
more files as new features are added.

```
foo/
  ├── FooService.ts
  ├── FooController.ts
  ├── parser/
  │   ├── parseXml.ts
  │   ├── parseTimestamp.ts
  │   └── types.ts
  ├── validator/
  │   ├── validateEmail.ts
  │   ├── validatePassword.ts
  │   └── types.ts
  └── utils.ts

```

And eventually, you will hit the point where the service gets
simply too large. What ends up happening then is that you split
the service into multiple services; or as you add new features,
choose to not add them to the existing service, but create
a new one instead.

```
service/
  ├── foo/
  │   ├── FooService.ts
  │   ├── FooController.ts
  │   └── utils.ts
  ├── parser/
  │   ├── ParserService.ts
  │   ├── parseXml.ts
  │   ├── parseTimestamp.ts
  │   └── types.ts
  ├── validator/
  │   ├── ValidatorService.ts
  │   ├── validateEmail.ts
  │   ├── validatePassword.ts
  │   └── types.ts
  └── ...

```

This is a problem, because now he have created architecture
that exists in our heads, but not in the codebase.

_We_ know that `FooService`, `ParserService` and `ValidatorService`
are all part of a single logical unit; they are tightly coupled
with `FooService` acting as a parent of `ParserService` and
`ValidatorService`, but the codebase does not reflect that.

That's because our `service/` directory is a flat structure, and
we have no way to express these tree-like relationships.

(There's also a second way to arrive at similar structures, that
is by starting out with seperate services that end up getting
tightly coupled over time.)

Now we could just move these three services into a folder,
[but that's not enough ceremony](../2025-06-15-enforcing-architecture-through-ceremony)
and doesn't isolate the logical units at all. You have to rely
on the goodwill of the developers to add services to the right
folder, and there is neither punishment nor reward for
doing so.

Well the other night I woke up at 3am and I think I have found
a solution to this problem.

Setting up an application takes 5 minutes and it's 2 files,
so why aren't we creating these hierarchical structures by
nesting applications within applications?

```
src/
  ├── README.md
  ├── package.json
  ├── tsconfig.json
  ├── .env
  ├── app/
  │   ├── appConfiguration.ts
  │   └── createApplication.ts
  └── service/
      ├── bar/
      ├── http/
      └── fooApplication/
          ├── README.md
          ├── app/
          │   ├── appConfiguration.ts
          │   ├── createApplication.ts
          |   └── FooApplicationService.ts
          └── service/
              ├── foo/
              ├── parser/
              └── validator/
```

Here, `fooApplication/app/createApplication.ts` creates an
Application much like the root app, and the addtional `FooApplicationService`
provices a service class that the root application instantiates,
which in turn creates a new FooApplication, creating all the
subservices.

## The fractal modulith

This is the fractal modulith. You can nest these applications
arbitrarily deep, and if your sub-applications get too large,
or your team grows, you can even turn these applications into
seperate deployables/microservices by just dragging the
`fooApplication/` folder into a new repository.

And then all the function calls from the sub-application to the
root application need to be replaced with HTTP calls, as do all
the calls from the root application to the sub-application.

If you have good enough architecture and organized enough devs,
you can even define two classes `Ingress` and `Egress` that you
can use to funnel all calls between the applications through,
and then migrating from a sub-application to a microservice
is just a matter of replacing the `Ingress` and `Egress` classes
with HTTP calls.

And, wild idea, if you have a way to create `HttpRequest` objects
in your code, the `Ingress` and `Egress` classes can even call
your controllers directly, making the migration to HTTP calls
even easier.

## I have not actually done this in production

I have not actually done this in production, but if I get the
chance, I will try it out in the next medium to large
greenfield project. There might be a way to streamline this
concept too but I haven't fully explored the space of possibilities
yet.

Maybe it makes sense to have a package.json in each sub-application
or maybe it doesn't. Running tests for each sub-application should
be easy but I haven't done the proof-of-concept. Do we need to
enforce somehow that crossing application boundaries is forbidden?
I wouldn't think so because if sub-app-1 needs to access sub-app-2,
It would need to go through the root application, which leads to
increadibly awkward-to-read-code, discouraging devs from doing
that. How are we dealing with shared utilities?

The fractal modulith concept does make a lot of sense to me though,
as we've found a way to smoothly transition from a single class to
a fully-blown microservice, which seems like a very agile way to
approach things.

But, lots of questions still to answer. But they are similar
questions to the ones we have to answer when designing microservice
architectures.
