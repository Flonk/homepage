This is part 3 of a series on Free objects.
[You can find part 2 here](/blog/2025-06-19-free-objects-2).

Not all operations are associative! In fact I'd think that given
the infinite space of all possible binary operations, 100% of
them are not. Though I wouldn't really know about that tbh.

But, take subtraction of numbers for example. Parentheses matter!

```ts
âŸ®1 - 2) - 3; // -4
1 - (2 - 3); // 2
```

In the previous posts we were able to store these kinds of
expressions in multisets and lists, but, dropping the associativity
requirement, we can no longer do that.

We can see that by naively constructing the list `[1, 2, 3]` for
the expressions above -- how would our `evaluate` function know
whether to return `-4` or `2`? It can't, because lists do not track
the way in which way operands were grouped.

We call this -- a non-associative monoid if you will -- a
**magma**. And basically, any set with any binary operation
meets the definition of a magma, so it's a very general
concept.

## Binary Finger Trees

If we want to construct a data structure that can store expressions
for any magma, a tree-like structure will do. You can imagine
"pinching" the outermost `-` in our expression above and then letting
the rest of the expression dangle from it.

```ts
"A tree for (1 - 2) - 3:"

      -
     / \
    -   3
   / \
  1   2

"And a tree for 1 - (2 - 3):"

      -
     / \
    1   -
       / \
      2   3
```

We call this tree _binary_, because each node has two children;
and we call it _finger_, because only leaf nodes have values,
and all the intermediate nodes contain no data.

Don't ask my why they call them finger trees. Maybe some kid named
"finger" invented them or something.

Let's jot down the type definition, and our `evaluate` function:

```ts
type BFT<T> =
  | { type: "leaf"; value: T }
  | { type: "node"; left: BFT<T>; right: BFT<T> };

type BinaryOperation<T> = (a: T, b: T) => T;

const evaluate = <T>(tree: BFT<T>, op: BinaryOperation<T>): T => {
  if (tree.type === "leaf") {
    return tree.value;
  }
  return op(evaluate(tree.left, op), evaluate(tree.right, op));
};
```

We can now construct a tree for our subtraction example like so:

```ts
const expression = {
  type: "node",
  left: {
    type: "node",
    left: { type: "leaf", value: 1 },
    right: { type: "leaf", value: 2 },
  },
  right: { type: "leaf", value: 3 },
};

const result = evaluate(expression, (a, b) => a - b); // -4
```

## A free magma

Since we've done this two times before, it shouldn't surprise you
that BFTs themselves are a magma. We can define a `merge`
operation that concatenates two trees, and returns a new tree:

```ts
const merge = <T>(a: BFT<T>, b: BFT<T>): BFT<T> => {
  return { type: "node", left: a, right: b };
};
```

And of course, just like before, we can express `(1 - 2) - 3` only
in terms of binary finger trees and their `merge` operation:

```ts
const lift = <T>(value: T): BFT<T> => ({ type: "leaf", value });

const expression = merge(merge(lift(1), lift(2)), lift(3));
```

Neat!

## Exercises

1. Go ahead an convince yourself that `expression` and our
   original concatenation problem are equivalent. To do that,
   replace each call to `merge` with `-`, and `lift` with
   nothing.

2. Convince yourself that the `merge` operation is **not** associative.
   Do that by taking some multisets `a`, `b`, and `c`, and
   showing that `merge(merge(a, b), c)` is not the same as
   `merge(a, merge(b, c))`.

3. Convince yourself that the `merge` operation is **not**
   commutative. Do that by taking some multisets `a` and `b`, and
   showing that `merge(a, b)` is not the same as `merge(b, a)`.

## Final thoughts

There it is, the **free magma** on `T`, the last of the three
Free objects we will be looking at in this series.
